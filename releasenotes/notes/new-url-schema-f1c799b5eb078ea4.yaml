features:
  - |
    The URL schema now uses message IDs, rather than patch IDs, by
    default. Old URLs will redirect to the new URLs.
  - |
    A new ``/message/aaa@bbb.ccc/`` URL has been added, which will
    look up a message by ID. If it exists as a patch, cover letter or
    comment in any project, it will redirect to that. If it exists in
    multiple projects, the project selection is arbitrary.

prelude: |
    The key part of this release is a major performance fix -
    denormalising the project field into patch model so that counting a
    project's patches doesn't require a JOIN. This requires a migration
    and so isn't suitable for a stable backport. Event listing in the API
    has also been sped up by refactoring the queries.

    This release also includes the feature development that had accured in
    the mean time, and numerous bug fixes.

    The REST API version has been bumped to 1.1.
issues:
  - Series parsing in the presence of parallel mail processing is still
    unreliable.
  - Several more minor issues can be browsed on our `issue tracker 
    <https://github.com/getpatchwork/patchwork/issues>`_.
fixes:
  - A nasty race condition bug that could cause patches in a series to be
    dropped has been fixed.
